\begin{frame}{Colors in beamer}

    {\color{blue} This is a blue block.}
    
    {\color{red} And this is a red one.}
    
    \begin{itemize}
    \color{green}
        \item This is a list.
        \item And it is colored!
    \end{itemize}
    
    Here I want to \colorbox{yellow}{highlight some
    important text in yellow} while leaving the rest
    untouched.
